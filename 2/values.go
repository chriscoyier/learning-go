// Lesson learned: I accidently named this file ` values.go` at first, with a space in front it, and it broke everything.

// Questions

// 1. What does `package main` mean? Does the `main` part refer to the fact that the func is named `main`? It seems to matter, I can't make them both `blah`

// 2. What does `import "fmt" mean? Does it mean "format"? I guess it has methods in it? Is `Println` used like `console.log`?
