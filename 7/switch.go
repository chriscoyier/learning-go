// Notes

// What's the difference between `Print` and `Println`? I see the output as `Write 2 as %     ` â€” just doesn't break the line when done?

// Weird to me that `switch` even exists at all since it seems like an easy one to punt to `if ` statements like so many other things.

// Is Go "white space dependant" language like Python? Do indents actually matter?

// This is making me wonder how programming languages know things like what time and day it is. Does it ultimately ask my operating system?

// Why doesn't `t := time.Now()` need a type? Does the type come from the function call?

// There is lots of stuff I'm not familar with here... `func(i interface{})` for example. Is `interface{}` the "type" for i now? Is that was is required for `i.(type)` to work? Why is `type` in parens?

// What is happening here? `("Don't know type %T\n", t)` - it looks like `t` is getting subbed into the string, but why is `T` uppercase then? Are there a such thing as template literals in Go where you can sprinkle the variables into the string?
